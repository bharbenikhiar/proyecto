<h2>The Beggining, from the Greeks' POV </h2>
        <p id="Chaos">It all began with Chaos, the primordial....'Til the day I die
            Funny how we both end happy but everything seems alright, ooh
            I wonder what will happen
            If we went back and put up a fight
            'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
            It’s clear… Stay or leave, the cabinets are bare and I'm unaware
                Of just how we got into this mess, got so aggressive
                I know we meant all good intentions</p>
                <p id="f"> used to be so happy
                    But without here I feel so low
                    I watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go
                    'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
                    It’s clear to see that time hasn’t changed a thing
                    It’s very deep inside me but I feel there’s something you should know
                    I’ll never forget you
                    You’ll always be by my side
                    From the day that I met you
                    I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
                    And I will never want much more
                    And in my heart I will always be sure
                    I will never forget you
                    And you’ll always be by my side 'til the day I die
