    <p id="modi">Hello, it's me
            I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
            To go over everything
            They say that time's supposed to heal ya
            But I ain't done much healing
            Hello, can you hear me
            I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
            When we were younger and free
            I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
            There's such a difference between us
            And a million miles
            Hello from the other side
            I must have called a thousand times
            To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
            But when I call you never seem to be home
            Hello from the outside
            At least I can say that I've tried
            To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
            But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
            Hello, how are you?
            It's soâ€¦
